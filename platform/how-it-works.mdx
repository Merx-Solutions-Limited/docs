## ðŸ§  AI Intelligence Layer

### How Our AI Understands Your Customers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language Processing">
    **Understanding Intent & Context**
    
    Our AI analyzes every message to understand:
    - What the customer is asking for
    - The emotional tone of their message
    - Their level of urgency or interest
    - Previous conversation context
    
    <Note>
    **Example**: When a customer says "I need help with my order," the AI immediately identifies this as a support request and routes to the appropriate flow.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Customer Memory">
    **Remembering What Matters**
    
    Merx AI maintains two types of memory:
    - **Explicit Memory**: Facts customers tell us to remember
    - **Automatic Memory**: Preferences we learn from behavior
    
    This means every conversation feels personal and continues where the last one left off.
    
    <Check>
    **Result**: Customers feel understood and valued, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Brand Voice Training">
    **Speaking Like Your Brand**
    
    Our AI learns your brand's unique voice by analyzing:
    - Your existing customer communications
    - Brand guidelines and tone preferences
    - Industry-specific terminology
    - Cultural and regional nuances
    
    <Tip>
    **Pro Tip**: The AI gets better over time as it learns from more customer interactions and your feedback.
